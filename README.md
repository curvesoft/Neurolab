compiled with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/).

The main branch is based on version 9.19 using the wingraph unit from Free Pascal 2.4 which is discontinued. The stable
branch ist based on the version 9.04 using the standard graphic window. All other developments have been merged into the stable
branch with version 10.01.
